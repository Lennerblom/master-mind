# Master Mind

Classic logic game where you try to replicate the hidden color sequence based off of clues provided from each attempt.

### How to play

To begin, click the `New Game` button.  Click the empty circles in the attempt area and assign each a color from the eight colors at the bottom.  Once all five circles in the attempt area have a color assigned, hit the  `submit` button.

### Clues
Each attempt is scored with  black, white or red pegs.  Black pegs are scored first followed by white.  You earn a black peg for each correct color in the corect location in the sequence.  A white peg represents a color in the sequence, but not in the correct location.  A red peg indicated no colors in the attempt are present in the solution.  Through these clues, you can make logical deductions to solve the colored sequence.
